# Stop Thinking in Pixels

## Abstract
We tend to like working with pixels. They are constant and easy to understand. But the real power of CSS is found in relative units: em and rem and vw/vh. Their exact meaning is determined with a “late binding” in the browser, where they change depending on their context.

In this talk, we’ll unravel the mystery of relative units. I’ll show you how to build flexible designs with simpler code. I’ll cover how to make your design responsive without a single media query. And we’ll dive into one of CSS’s newest tricks: CSS Variables, which offer far more flexibility and control than the SASS/LESS variables you may be used to.

Come learn how to stop thinking in pixels and embrace CSS’s late binding of styles.
