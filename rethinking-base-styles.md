# Rethinking Base styles

## Abstract
A well-organized stylesheet is written in layers: the more general styles appear first, and lay the foundation for the more specific styles later. Letâ€™s explore some strategies for improving our general styles, so the specific styles are easier (or unnecessary!) to write. This talk will look at some ways to leverage the cascade instead of fighting or avoiding it, how to build layouts that behave responsively without media queries, and generally reduce the need for more and more specific styles later in our stylesheet.
