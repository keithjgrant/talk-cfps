# The Decentralized Social Web

## Description
We tend to have a love/hate relationship with social networks. The ability to interact with friends, colleagues, and even celebrities is wonderful, but the lack of control over privacy or content algorithms is troubling. A better way lies ahead, where you aren't tied to large social networks and where you can own your own data. Come see a vision for a decentralized Social Web.

## Abstract
What if, instead of following your friend Scott-on-Twitter, you could just follow your friend Scott? Or instead of “friending” your co-worker Melissa-on-Facebook, you could just subscribe to articles she posts? Instead of maintaining multiple profiles across each social network, you could have on central “home” for your online presence. People could subscribe to your content; you could subscribe to theirs. You could share articles, “like” posts, and leave comments. What if the entire Internet were one big decentralized social network?

This might sound far-fetched, but the groundwork has already been laid. The W3C has open standards for this very thing, built using currently-available technology. It could revolutionize the Internet itself. Let's take a look at what this standard offers, how you can use it today, and how you can integrate it with existing social networks.

Today’s social networks are a stopgap. A better way lies ahead, built on Webmentions and Social Web Protocols, where you aren't beholden to large companies and where you can own your own data. Come see a vision for a decentralized Social Web.
