## Description
Managing CSS is hard. Doing so successfully goes beyond


## Abstract
How we write our CSS — not only the code we save to file, but also our processes and our team organization — has a marked influence on how well it can be understood. Code is communication: to the computer, and also to other developers. The use of certain methodologies and pattern libraries help with this, but these are most effective when they are part of a bigger picture.

Code clarity is especially important in CSS. Most languages allow for meaningful variable and function names to promote self-documenting code. But CSS has few opportunities for such luxeries.
Even when the documentation is clear, your team also needs a resident expert on your styles, and an established process for making changes.

In this talk we will explore the confluence of best practices, how CSS fits into overall system architecture, and communication and coordination with your team. I’ll share some real-world experience and show you how to approach development in a way that works for the CSS-adept as well as CSS-averse developers on your team.
