# CSS for Engineers

# Abstract
If you think CSS is just for designers who tinker with pixels and colors, think again.  It takes both sides of your brain to write CSS.  If you are a left-brain thinker, come see why CSS is for you, too.

Let's explore why software design principles like DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), SRP (Single Responsibility Principle), and the Open/Closed principle apply to stylesheets.  We’ll look at modern approaches like SMACSS and BEM and how they apply object-oriented solutions to CSS.  We will see how the CSS you write defines an abstract API that your entire front-end stack depends upon, and why an Engineer’s mindset is needed when writing styles for your site or web app.
