* There is No “I” in CSS

## Description
In this talk we will explore the confluence of best practices, how CSS fits into overall system architecture, and communication and coordination with your team. I’ll share some real-world experience and show you how to approach development in a way that works for the CSS-adept as well as CSS-averse developers on your team.


## Abstract
How we write our CSS — not only the code we save to file, but also our processes and our team organization — has a marked influence on how well it can be understood. Code is communication: to the computer, and to other developers. The use of certain methodologies and pattern libraries help with this, but these are most effective when they are part of a bigger picture.

Code clarity is especially important in CSS. Most languages allow for meaningful variable and function names to promote self-documenting code. But CSS has few opportunities for such luxuries.
Even when the documentation is clear, your team also needs a resident expert on your styles, and an established process for making changes.

I’ll share some real-world experience and show you how to approach development in a way that works for the CSS-adept as well as CSS-averse developers on your team.
