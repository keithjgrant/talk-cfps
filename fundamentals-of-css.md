# Fundamentals of CSS


# Abstract
When you start learning CSS, itâ€™s easy to get wrapped up in rounded corners, colors, and complex positioning.  If you want to try CSS, but are having a hard time getting off the ground, this is the place to start.  Everything else in CSS is built upon these five principles.  Even if you are moderately versed in styles, this will give you a more solid understanding of the basics.  You will continue to learn CSS faster and write it more proficiently with a solid understanding of these fundamentals.
