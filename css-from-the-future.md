# CSS from the Future

# Abstract
For years, we’ve relied on preprocessors to simplify CSS development, but the time is coming when we won’t need this anymore. Variables, mixins, mathematic calculations, color manipulation, and nested selectors: many of these are in the official specification, and the rest are being considered. Nearly every feature provided by SASS and LESS is coming to the browser. Some of it has already arrived. Some of it is even more powerful than the preprocessor you are used to.

In this talk, I’ll show you how all these features work. And I’ll show you how, using the PostCSS processor, you can transpile this future syntax into code you can use today. Come take a glimpse at what the future of CSS holds.
